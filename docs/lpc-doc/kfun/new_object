DESCRIPTION
	Create a new light-weight instance of the specified object with a name
	of the form "object_name#-1".  If the master object is itself a light-
	weight object, it will be copied.  Light-weight objects cannot be

	to them is removed.
	The new object is returned.  The creator function will be called in the
	new object immediately.
