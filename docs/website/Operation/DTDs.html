<h3 style="text-align: center">UNQ DTDs: What Are They?</h3>

<p>Like XML, UNQ can be used to store structured data. Like XML,
UNQ uses files called Document Type Definitions to define the
document's structure. "Document Type Definition" is usually
abbreviated as DTD, both for UNQ and XML.</p>

<p>UNQ DTDs are stored in DTD files. They can't currently be
embedded in the actual UNQ file they refer to. Since we normally
use a single DTD for a much larger batch of UNQ data, that's
currently considered a reasonable restriction. If you need it
changed, the code is all public, and the entire UNQ system is
relatively easy to extract from Phantasmal.</p>

<p>An UNQ DTD file defines the DTD with an UNQ structure. Here's an
example:</p>
<pre>
~DTD{
  ~object{name,number?,location?,bdesc,gdesc,ldesc,edesc?,location,nouns,
           adjectives?}
  ~name{string}
  ~location{string}
  ~number{integer}
  ~bdesc{phrase}
  ~gdesc{phrase}
  ~ldesc{phrase}
  ~edesc{phrase}
  ~nouns{phrase+}
  ~adjectives{phrase*}
}
  
</pre>

<p>The outside label <i>must</i> be "DTD", as above. The inner
labels describe the fields of the structure defined by the DTD.
There are built-in data types called "phrase", "string" and
"integer" that are fairly self-explanatory (a "phrase" is a
localized string type used by Phantasmal &mdash; it can just be a
string, which is assumed to be English, or can contain translations
to zero or more other languages).</p>

<p>Inside the curly braces after each inner label there are zero or
more data types, possibly followed by characters like "*" and "?".
If there are more than one, they are separated by commas. The entry
above would match UNQ text like what follows:</p>
<pre>
~object{
  ~name{snowglobe}
  ~bdesc{a snowglobe}
  ~gdesc{a snowglobe with a snowman inside}
  ~ldesc{~enUS{The snowglobe has a ~i{snowman} inside, and tiny white flakes
               swirl around inside.}}
  ~edesc{The snowman has a carrot nose!  How cute!}
  ~nouns{{~enUS{snowman}~esUS{hombre de nieve}}
         {snowglobe}
         {globe}{flakes}{snow}}
  ~adjectives{{snowy}{snow-filled}}
}
  
</pre>

<p>The trailing characters tell the parser how many instances of
the data type to match. For instance, if there are no trailing
characters and the type is integer (such as in the "number" entry,
above) then inside the curly braces should be a single whole
number. You could add the line <tt>~number{374}</tt> to the data
above and it would parse just fine. The UNQ data would fit the
DTD.</p>

<p>A trailing question mark means that zero or one instances are
allowed. In the definition of "object", you'll see "number?" in
between the commas. That means that you can include it or not, but
you can have no more than one.</p>

<p>A plus sign means that you can have one or more of something. So
in the definition of "nouns", where it says "phrase+", that means
that you can have several nouns, or just one. However, if you have
the "nouns" entry, you must have at least one phrase there. The "*"
symbol is similar, but you can have none at all. The "adjectives"
field uses that because you don't need to have any adjectives for
an object.</p>

<p>The "integer" built-in type means a whole number, which can be
positive or negative. The "string" type is any normal text. The
"unq" built-in type is like a string, except that you can include
UNQ tags (as long as they're balanced and the UNQ is valid!)
inside. The "float" built-in type means a floating-point number,
which is to say a number that can have a decimal fraction with it
like "3.743". Floating-point numbers can also be either positive or
negative.</p>
