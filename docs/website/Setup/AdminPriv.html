<h3>Administrator Directories and Privileges</h3>

<p>Since "wizard" may be a class in your MUD and "Immortal" may be
an in-character thing too, we like to call them "Administrators".
However, no matter what you call them, you'd like to be able to
give them different levels of power. That's where those directories
can help you.</p>

<p>An Implementor or Head Admin is probably going to need ultimate
cosmic power in your MUD. You'll want to give him or her full
access to all directories. To put it in Phantasmal's terms, you'll
want to "%grant headadmin / full", which is how an existing head
admin awards that power from the command line. If you give somebody
that kind of power, the MUD will let them shut down or reboot the
MUD. It'll let them create and destroy any object in the game.
It'll let them crash the MUD in ways you can't repair. It'll let
them delegate that power to anybody they feel like. About the only
thing they can't do is alter the Kernel Library or other
non-Phantasmal files on your machine. You'd better <i>totally</i>
trust somebody before you give them this level of power.</p>

<p>A coder customizing Phantasmal for you (not just your game), or
an admin that needs to debug it, will need write access to
/usr/common. That will let them change the laws of physics in your
MUD, the nature of objects, and the ways time and space are
managed. This can cause ugly, ugly bugs and you should be careful
who you give access to. You don't want to let anybody do this to
your running MUD except your head Implementor. He should only use
that access to fix serious bugs.</p>

<p>A high-ranking admin, a coder or a Head Builder will probably
need full access to your game, but not necessarily to Phantasmal.
That means you have <i>some</i> security against them, but they can
still do anything they want to the player-visible bits. You'll want
to give them at least write access to /usr/game, and maybe full
access. Write access lets them put stuff there, while full access
lets them delegate power to it. This will let them change the laws
of physics on your MUD to some extent, and write very powerful
scripts and functions, but they still can't alter any of the
previously-mentioned stuff directly. This is also the access needed
to add new rooms and areas to the MUD, and remove existing
areas.</p>

<p>A new admin will automatically get full access (including
delegation) to their own directory. This lets them build
interesting things in isolation, but not to hook them up to your
running MUD. A probationary builder needs this level of access, and
probably no more. A normal builder will only need this level of
access when Phantasmal is more polished, and the head builder can
then hook their stuff up to the running MUD, or copy it over into
game directories.</p>
