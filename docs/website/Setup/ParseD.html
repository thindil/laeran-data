<h2>Configuring the ParseD</h2>

<p>The command line is the most direct interface between your
players and your MUD. Phantasmal offers customization of the parser
so that you can give your players the best possible experience in
interacting with your game. The following is Phantasmal's idealized
parsing architecture. Not all of it will be immediately
available.</p>

<h3>How the Parser Works</h3>

<h4>Tokenizing and Parts of Speech</h4>

<p>First, the parser looks over various words and decides what
parts of speech they're allowed to be. For instance, the word
"fast" can be an adjective or adverb, but can also be a noun or a
verb. Most words aren't quite as versatile -- "green" is a noun or
an adjective, but almost never a verb, and definitely not an
adverb.</p>

<p>Some parts of speech are gathered from your existing data. Since
your objects already have a wide variety of nouns and adjectives,
Phantasmal registers all of them with the ParseD. If you see a
message like "I don't know the word 'clock'", it probably means
that you have no object in your game with the noun 'clock'. You can
add it to the game's vocabulary simply by creating a clock object
anywhere in your MUD. Adjectives (and eventually plural and
possessive nouns) work the same way.</p>

<p>Verbs are registered specifically with the parser. Note that
verbs are <i>not</i> the same as actions in your MUD. For instance,
it's quite reasonable to make the phrase "get down" mean to dance,
even though 'get' usually means to take an object. Most MUDs don't
allow this, or would require you to code it into the 'get' action.
Verbs are categorized as either <b>intransitive</b> (i.e. not
taking a direct object), <b>transitive</b> (i.e. taking a direct
object, and perhaps an indirect object as well), or both. An
example of a verb which is both is 'sing' -- you may say 'sing' by
itself, or give it a direct object, as in "sing something by
Vivaldi".</p>

<p>Adverbs currently don't do anything, but they'll eventually be
able to be registered. Those will be important primarily for social
verbs, though phrases like "walk carefully" or "sneak silently"
should eventually be possible, and may even modify the action if
the game so chooses.</p>

<p>Special words like conjunctions (and, but, yet, so, for, and,
nor) and prepositions (into, around, under, behind, of, on, on top
of, underneath, etc) are currently hardcoded into the parser, and
are likely to be for quite some time.</p>

<p>This division by what parts of speech a word may be is called
'tokenizing'. The now-categorized words are called 'tokens'.</p>

<h4>Grammar and Parsing</h4>

<p>The parser will then examine all of these words and come up with
possible sentence structures. For instance, the phrase "move the
box under the table" might be parsed with the prepositional phrase
modifying the box, or modifying the table. "Fast and quickly run"
can mean either of two things, depending on whether 'fast' is meant
as a verb or an adverb. Each sentences can each have attributes for
things like grammar and perceived appropriateness.</p>

<p>At this point, the sentences have been parsed only
grammatically. The nouns haven't been checked against available
people and objects, and the verbs (and corresponding actions)
haven't been checked to see if they are possible or appropriate.
"Eat the red shoe behind the mother of checkered bobcat" will be
considered just as valid as "go north", except perhaps for the
grammatical nitpick in the former.</p>

<h4>Verb Resolution and Binding</h4>

<p>The next stage accomplishes <i>verb resolution</i> and
<i>binding</i>. Verb resolution checks the appropriateness of
certain grammatical constructions, and maps the sentence into an
action. Binding matches noun phrases to objects in the
environment.</p>

<p>The various parsed sentences from the previous stage are passed
to an LPC object representing the verb. That object decides how
binding should be accomplished, and calls an internal Binder API to
accomplish the actual binding. Verbs that take hypothetical
subjects may do no binding at all -- 'watch for hairy green forks'
may be a perfectly valid thing to say even if no hairy green forks
exist anywhere in the game. The 'watch' verb would simply choose
not to bind that noun phrase, and instead pass it through verbatim
to the 'watch' action.</p>

<p>For most actions, the binding will locate an object in the
immediate environment. For instance, in the phrase "get the third
sticky grape", binding would look for objects that might be called
sticky grapes, and choose the third of them. There may eventually
even be support for comparative and superlative adjectives -- "get
the hottest potato in the bin". But currently no such thing
exists.</p>

<p>More complex sentence structures are possible, and binding will
occur on them in this stage as well. In the phrase "remove a pen
from the big box", the big box will also be resolved by the
binder.</p>

<p>Normally, if an object can't be found by the binder or for some
other reason the sentence seems impossible, it still won't be
thrown out. If the player types "get the green emerald" and there's
no emerald available, it's important to receive a message like "You
can't find one.". So the sentence should be marked as unlikely (in
case there's some other way to parse the sentence that makes more
sense), but it shouldn't be rejected outright since they may indeed
have meant what they typed, even if it's not currently
possible.</p>

<h4>Action Resolution</h4>

<p>Once the verbs have done appropriate preprocessing, the action
object receives the mostly-parsed sentence structure. Action
structures are fully specific to your game, and so they can decode
information like whether a particular noun is edible. That's useful
so you can realize that "take cake from oven and eat it" probably
means to eat the cake, not the oven. The 'eat' action will rate
both as possible meanings, but the cake should score higher for
appropriateness, and so it should be chosen in favor of trying to
eat the oven.</p>

<p>The actions should encode only things reasonably known to the
player character. For instance, if an object is poisonous but the
character doesn't know that, the parser should treat it like any
other edible object. If a particular action will result in disaster
but the player couldn't reasonably know, don't mark it as unlikely.
Players will find ways to cheat by referring to the action
ambiguously. On the other hand, if one possible interpretation is
to stick a dagger into the character's own eye, the player probably
didn't mean that. At least, not if there's another choice.</p>

<h4>Finally, Choosing an Action</h4>

<p>There are now one or more possible interpretations of the
player's input that Phantasmal has scrutinized, and it's merely a
matter of deciding on which. Based on appropriateness, grammar,
likeliness to damage the character and other factors, ParseD will
decide which interpretations are most likely. If there is only one
candidate, or only one credible candidate, that action will be
taken. If the obvious action is also dangerous, the player may be
prompted to see if he <i>really</i> meant to type that. If there
are multiple good possibilities, the player may be prompted which
he meant.</p>
