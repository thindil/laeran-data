<h3>Using the distrib_builder Script</h3>

<p>Whether you use the Bundled release, the regular release or CVS,
you'll need to decide whether you want to work on everything in one
lump or use the distrib_builder script. The distrib_builder script
takes a DGD directory, a Phantasmal directory, and (optionally) a
game directory and puts them together into a Phantasmal Game
Bundle, such as the Bundled release of Phantasmal. Since putting
together a Phantasmal package requires a lot of copying and
testing, you can save yourself a lot of work by using the
distrib_builder script. You can either use it once to set up your
Bundle, or you can use it constantly for testing.</p>

<p>If you decide to use the distrib_builder script constantly for
testing, you'll do your editing in your subdirectories (mudlib and
your specific game's directory - mostly your specific game's
directory) and then run the distrib_builder script every time you
want a testable MUD bundle. <i>Please</i> remember that changes
made in your game bundle directory will be <i>deleted</i> when you
copy over the new bundle, so <i>don't</i> do a lot of work there
and then lose it by copying over all the old versions...</p>

<h3>How to Use the Script</h3>

<p>You'll probably want a directory where all your Phantasmal-based
code lives. It's the directory you were in when you first did a CVS
checkout of the Phantasmal code, if you're using the CVS version.
We'll refer to it as "code" throughout this section.</p>

<p>Your Phantasmal directory will be immediately under the code
directory. You'll also want to check out the 'tools' module from
CVS, which contains the Perl script you'll be running. If you're
starting with 'Seas of Night' rather than plain Phantasmal, you'll
also want to check out the 'testgame' module, which contains Seas
of Night. So, your code directory will contain directories called
'phantasmal', 'tools', and 'testgame'. Change into the 'tools'
directory.</p>

<p>If your checkout was successful, there will be a file called
'distrib_builder.pl' in that directory (among others). Make sure
you have Perl installed on your system, and then run the script.
You can run it by typing 'perl distrib_builder.pl', or (in Unix
only) by executing the file directly, as a command. This starts the
script.</p>

<p>If you have put the appropriate things in the appropriate
places, the distrib_builder script will find your installations of
DGD and Phantasmal, and ask if you want to use the appropriate
directory for each. If distrib_builder can't find DGD or
Phantasmal, or if you tell it not to use any of the installations
it finds, you can then tell it a directory to check. That directory
<i>must</i> contain a valid DGD or Phantasmal installation. If it
doesn't, distrib_builder will complain and will refuse to use
it.</p>

<p>If the testgame module is present, distrib_builder will ask you
if you want to use it. If it isn't checked out, distrib_builder
will ask you if you want to use the built-in game in your
Phantasmal directory (by asking if you want to use your Phantasmal
directory as the game directory). The choice is yours. Either
should work fine, though you'll get a different game from testgame
and phantasmal - they're different from each other, and
intentionally so.</p>

<p>The distrib_builder script will put the game bundle into its own
directory under your code directory. If there is already a bundle
there, the script will ask if you wish to delete it. It is
<i>highly</i> recommended that you do so to avoid stale files. If
you don't wish to delete the game bundle and want to cancel the
script's action, you should hit &lt;CTRL&gt;-C immediately - if the
script is allowed to complete, it will overwrite many of the files
in your game bundle, which is pretty certainly <i>not</i> what you
want if you plan to keep it.</p>
