<h2>Object Inheritance</h2>

<p>One way to potentially save yourself some time, when building
objects that have some relationship to each other, is to build a
parent object for some or all of them. For instance if you're
building a large number of sun-drenched rooms in an outdoor
labyrinth somewhere then an awfully large number of them are likely
to have grass, sunlight, a hedge, a view of a tower and so on. You
can put all those various details into a single parent object and
make your tens or hundreds of labyrinth rooms all implement them
automatically. This tutorial can show you how.</p>

<p>At the moment, inheritance is primarily a way to inherit
<a href="Details.html">object details</a>. That's a useful thing,
but it doesn't do everything. We hope that object nouns and
adjectives will also be inheritable soon. Things like weights,
heights, etc should already be. We're considering object
descriptions, but it's not entirely clear how that should work.</p>

<p>So, back to that sun-drenched labyrinth. You're going to need a
parent room, which should be clearly marked as such and not
connected (via exits) to any other room anywhere, to avoid people
randomly walking into it and changing stuff. So use
<b>@make_room</b> to make just such a thing. Your parent rooms are
allowed to have their own parents, but in this example there's
probably no reason to bother. Take note of the parent room's object
number, when you find out what it is.</p>

<p>For your brief and glance descriptions you should put something
like "labyrinth parent room", and for your look description you
should put something like "this room contains details for other
labyrinth rooms. You should never, never be able to enter it."</p>

<p>You'll also want an ordinary labyrinth test room to try out the
nifty inheritance tricks. Go ahead and create one with
<b>@make_room</b>. Up to this point, when <b>@make_room</b> asks
you for a parent object, you've probably just been hitting enter to
leave it blank. And that's been the right thing to do. But when you
make the labyrinth test room, you should instead type the number of
the labyrinth parent room -- the one we told you to take note of
awhile back. You did, right?</p>

<p>The description can be whatever you like, but for the full
example experience, I recommend mentioning sunshine and a distant
tower in the desc.</p>

<p>Now, go ahead and make a new detail with <b>@make_detail</b>.
Make it a part of the labyrinth <i>parent</i> room, not the
labyrinth <i>test</i> room. Describe the sunshine playing on the
grass and hedges, and how you can see the dust motes playing in it.
Give it nouns like <b>sun</b>, <b>sunshine</b>, <b>dust</b> and
<b>motes</b>, and adjectives like <b>bright</b>, <b>shiny</b> and
<b>dust</b> (so that you can look at the dust motes and get the
same desc).</p>

<p>To test it out, go to the labyrinth parent room and look at the
dust motes. Now go back to the labyrinth test room and do the same.
If you want, go ahead and add more details to the labyrinth parent
rooms for things like grass, the tower, the hedges and the other
stuff you can see. In a <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a>
room you'd be spending two or three hours at least on all the
descriptions, so don't be shy about taking ten or fifteen minutes
on this. Players eat this stuff up. And remember, every minute you
spend on the details in the parent room is that much more detail in
<i>every child room</i>.</p>

<p>So test it out. Make another child room. That's another room
like the labyrinth test room, one that also inherits from the
labyrinth parent room (whose number you still remember, yeah?).
After making this fresh-minted room with <b>@make_room</b> and
giving it the labyrinth parent room as a parent, go ahead and look
around at the grass, the dust motes, and everything else you made
details for. And there they are!</p>

<p>Note how just by making a room with a cool parent, you've
suddenly gotten a lot of details for free. This is inheritance, but
it's not the kind you're used to in an Object Oriented programming
language (just in case you're a programmer). That kind of
inheritance is also called <b>code inheritance</b> because it's
code being inherited. Those languages almost never allow <b>data
inheritance</b>, which is what you're seeing here in Phantasmal.
That's because these details are object data, not methods or any
other kind of code. MUDs tend to be better served by data
inheritance, at least for "physical" objects.</p>

<p>The only other thing you should know about inheritance is the
way to change or remove object parents. The <b>@set_obj_parent</b>
command is your friend here (check its online help!). You can set
an object #1124's parent to object #375 by saying "@set_obj_parent
#1124 #375". You can then make it parentless again by saying
"@set_obj_parent #1124 #-1" or (in recent versions of Phantasmal)
"@set_obj_parent #1124 none".</p>

<p>Now go build some more stuff by following the <a href=
