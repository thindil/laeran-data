<h2>Basic Objects</h2>

<p>You've got exactly as clean a start as you want. Either way,
you're ready to mess around and make an object or two. So let's get
started with some practical examples.</p>

<p>The best objects to get started on are rooms. Trust me. So let's
make some.</p>

<p>There's this whole set of segments and a command, @segmap, to
play with them. Or you can do it the easy way. You can get help on
all that stuff (@help segments, @help @segmap) on your own time.
Here we'll do it the easy way.</p>

<p>Go ahead and type "@make_room" by itself on the command line.
You'll be asked a series of questions about your room, which you'll
need to answer. For instance, first it'll ask you to give it a room
number or hit enter. I'd just hit enter if I were you, and you'll
get the first available room number in the current zone. It'll also
ask you for a parent for the room. I'd just hit enter again -- you
haven't got any specific other room set up as a parent room.</p>

<p>Then it'll ask you for a brief description (type "my boudoir") a
glance description (type "my spiffy bedroom") and a look
description (type something about your bedroom. Then hit enter
again. Then type a tilde (also called a twiddle: "~") and hit enter
again.</p>

<p>Then it'll ask you for an examine description. Just type another
twiddle and hit enter again. That'll default it to the look
description, which is what you want in this example. For nouns,
tell it "boudoir bedroom room". For adjectives tell it
"spiffy".</p>

<p>There may be some other questions -- about <a href=
"Weight.html">Height, Weight or Length</a> for example. If there
are any more questions, go ahead and use defaults for them, or
choose what seem like reasonable answers.</p>

<p>Now you've got quite the room going. Phantasmal will tell you
something like "room #74 added to Zone #0 (Unzoned)". Take that
room number (74 in our example) and stat it. That is, type "@stat
#74". You'll get something like:</p>
<pre>
&gt; @stat #74
Location:  (none)
Descriptions (enUS)
Brief:
  'my boudoir'
Glance:
  'my spiffy bedroom'
Look:
  'My bedroom.  It's mine.  All mine!'
Examine:
  (defaults to Look desc)
Nouns (enUS): boudoir bedroom
Adjectives (enUS): spiffy

Contains objects [0]: 
Contains 0 mobiles.

Registered with MAPD as a room.
    
</pre>

<p>Contains no mobiles? Why that means that you're not standing in
it. You should fix that. Go ahead and type "@goto #74", but make
sure to use the actual number you got, not necessarily 74.</p>
<pre>
&gt; @goto #74
You teleport to my boudoir.
my boudoir
My bedroom.  It's mine.  All mine!
*****

Exits: 
    
</pre>

<p>Okay, so now you can give an object a basic description. Fair
enough. What else can you do with it? Well, you can move it around.
Go ahead and move it to wherever you're standing -- type "@move #2
here", which will teleport it to be inside whatever room you're
standing in. You can also teleport it somewhere else -- for
instance "@move #2 #0" will move it into The Void. You can teleport
there ("@goto #0") to make sure it arrived okay.</p>

<p>You've got nouns and adjectives for it, so if you've teleported
it into your current room, you can look at it -- type "look spiffy
bedroom" for instance, or " look boudoir". You'll find out more
about nouns and adjectives later, or in the help files for
@add_noun and @add_adjective.</p>

<p>If you haven't had a look at the build help yet by typing "@help
builder", you should.</p>
