<h2>Object Inheritance</h2>

<p><i>Note: a lot of this is new to Phantasmal 0.016. If you're
still using a previous version, allow me to recommend the <a href=
"OldInheritance.html">old inheritance tutorial</a> rather than this
one.</i></p>

<p>One way to potentially save yourself some time, when building
objects that have some relationship to each other, is to build a
parent object for some or all of them. If you're building a large
number of sun-drenched rooms in an outdoor labyrinth then lots of
them are likely to have grass, sunlight, a hedge, a view of a tower
and so on. You can put all those various details into a single
parent object and make your tens or hundreds of labyrinth rooms all
implement them automatically. This tutorial can show you how.</p>

<p>As a time-saver, inheritance is primarily a way to inherit
<a href="Details.html">object details</a>. That's a useful thing,
but it doesn't do everything. Object nouns and adjectives will also
be inheritable as of Phantasmal 0.016. Things like weights and
heights already are. We're considering inheriting object
descriptions, but it's not entirely clear how the commands for that
should work.</p>

<p>So, back to that sun-drenched labyrinth. You're going to need a
parent room, which should be clearly marked as such and not
connected (via exits) to any other room anywhere. That keeps people
from randomly walking into it and changing stuff. So use
<b>@make_room</b> to make the parent room. Your parent rooms are
allowed to have their own parents, but in this example there's
probably no reason to bother. Take note of the parent room's object
number when <b>@make_room</b> tells you what it is.</p>

<p>For your brief and glance descriptions you should put something
like "labyrinth parent room", and for your look description you
should put something like "this room contains details for other
labyrinth rooms. You should never, never be able to enter it." You
shouldn't add any exits to or from it. Remember that if anybody
ever changes something here it will be propagated to all your child
rooms, so only change the parent room if you actually <i>mean</i>
to.</p>

<p>You'll also want an ordinary labyrinth test room to try out the
nifty inheritance tricks. Go ahead and create one with
<b>@make_room</b>. Up to this point, when <b>@make_room</b> asks
you for a parent object, you've probably just been hitting enter to
leave it blank. And that's been the right thing to do. But when you
make the labyrinth test room, you should instead type the number of
the labyrinth parent room -- the one we told you to take note of
awhile back. You wrote it down when <b>@make_room</b> told it to
you, right?</p>

<p>The description can be whatever you like, but for the full
example experience, I recommend mentioning sunshine and a distant
tower in the description. That way people can look at them.</p>

<p>Now, go ahead and make a new detail with <b>@make_detail</b>.
Make it a part of the labyrinth <i>parent</i> room, not the
labyrinth <i>test</i> room. Describe the sunshine playing on the
grass and hedges, and how you can see the dust motes swirling in
it. Give the sunshine nouns like <b>sun</b>, <b>sunshine</b>,
<b>dust</b> and <b>motes</b>, and adjectives like <b>bright</b>,
<b>shiny</b> and <b>dust</b>. That's so that you can look at the
dust motes, the shiny motes or the sunshine and get the same
description back.</p>

<p>To test it out, go to the labyrinth parent room and look at the
dust motes. Now go back to the labyrinth test room and do the same.
If you want, go ahead and add more details to the labyrinth parent
room for things like grass, the tower, the hedges and the other
stuff you can see. If you were a <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> builder doing a Castle Marrach
room you'd be spending two or three hours at least on all the
descriptions, so don't be shy about taking ten or fifteen minutes
on this. Your best role-players will eat this stuff up. And
remember, every minute you spend on the details in the parent room
is that much more detail in <i>every</i> child room. That's how
inheritance in Phantasmal saves you time!</p>

<p>So test it out. Make another child room. That's another room
like the labyrinth test room, one that also inherits from the
labyrinth parent room (whose number you still remember, yeah?).
After making this fresh-minted room with <b>@make_room</b> and
giving it the labyrinth parent room as a parent, go ahead and look
around at the grass, the dust motes, and everything else you made
details for. And there they are!</p>

<p>Note how just by making a room with a cool parent, you've
suddenly gotten a lot of details for free. This is inheritance, but
it's not the kind you're used to in an Object Oriented programming
language (just in case you're a programmer). That kind of
inheritance is also called <b>code inheritance</b> because it's
code being inherited. Those languages almost never allow <b>data
inheritance</b>, which is what you're seeing here in Phantasmal.
That's because these details are object data, not methods or any
other kind of code. MUDs tend to be better served by data
inheritance, at least for "physical" objects in the MUD world.</p>

<p>What if you want to make a room that's a little different? Let's
say you want a cool, shady labyrinth room in one specific place,
but you'd like the grass, the view of the tower and so on to stay
the same. Make a new room and call it "shady labyrinth room".
Describe it appropriately. But make sure that its parent is still
the same labyrinth parent. So to start out with, it looks just like
the other sunny labyrinth rooms. How do you change it?</p>

<p>First, add a detail to the new shady room. You might give it
nouns like 'hedge', 'shade' and 'shadow', and adjectives like
'shady' and 'cool'. Then when a player looks at the cool shadow or
the shady hedge, he'll see the new shady version. Check out your
new room with the <b>@stat</b> command -- you should see a detail
list with the new detail, and also a detail list with the full set
of details from the parent as well.</p>

<p>But you'd like to get rid of the sunshine and dust motes above,
since they shouldn't be here, or shouldn't look the same. To do
that, remove the detail from the child object. That's right:
<i>remove the parent's detail from the child object</i>. Each child
object keeps a list of parent details that it overrides -- details
that the parent has, but the child does not. By removing the
parent's detail, you add the removed detail to that internal list.
Doublecheck with <b>@stat</b>. The parent detail for sunshine and
dust motes should be gone.</p>

<h3>Multiple Inheritance</h3>

<p>An object can have more than one parent. Some attributes like
weight, height, weight_capacity and so on are inherited entirely
from the first parent. Other attributes like nouns and details are
combined from all parents. If you wanted to make certain labyrinth
rooms shady and other sunny, and make certain rooms large and
others small, you could make large and small parent rooms, and
shady and sunny parent rooms, then inherit from either large or
small and either shady or sunny to combine them. The volume
capacity of the room (and thus, how many players may be inside it
at once) is set from the first parent, which would be either large
or small. However, the details are from <i>all</i> parents, so the
room would also inherit the shady or sunny detail objects from the
shady or sunny rooms. Additional parent objects that add extra
details, nouns, adjectives, etc are called <b>mixin</b> objects, or
<b>mixin</b> parents because the mix additional details in without
interacting directly with the other parent classes.</p>

<p>Usually it's easier to inherit another room from a parent object
before having the child inherit it than to make mixin objects. For
instance, if all rooms were the same size but you had both shady
and sunny rooms, then you could make a "labyrinth room" parent, and
then inherit shady and sunny children from it. However, if you have
multiple attributes that vary independently, you may find a mixin
parent is easiest. For instance, you could have <i>shady, small</i>
rooms, <i>sunny, large</i> rooms, <i>shady, large</i> rooms or
<i>sunny, small</i> rooms in the above, so it made sense. If every
small room is also shady and every large room is also sunny, you're
probably better off avoiding multiple inheritance -- it can be
complicated to use. The single-inheritance solution is easier.</p>

<h3>The @set_object_parent command</h3>

<p>The only other thing you should know about inheritance is the
way to change or remove object parents. The <b>@set_obj_parent</b>
command is your friend here (check its online help!). You can set
an object #1124's parent to object #375 by saying "@set_obj_parent
#1124 set #375". You can then make it parentless again by saying
"@set_obj_parent #1124 none". You can set multiple parents by
saying "@set_obj_par #1124 add #391 #241", or "@set_obj_par #1124
set #375 #391 #241". Note that the order of the parents matters,
and that added parents are appended to the <i>end</i> of the
list.</p>

<p>Note that parents are also called <b>Archetypes</b>, and that
Skotos calls them <i>ur-objects</i>. Phantasmal uses the internal
name 'archetype', but tends to call them parents in the help and
tutorials because people find the word less imposing.</p>
