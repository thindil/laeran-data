<h2>Access, Resources and Quotas</h2>

<h3>Admin Access and Path Permissions</h3>

<p>Remember that incantation you did way back when, the one you
used to give you administrator character his power as a Mighty
Admin? Now we'll get around to letting you know how that worked and
what similar things you can do.</p>

<p>Phantasmal has its roots in the Kernel Library, and nowhere is
that more obvious than in these commands right here. There's a full
permissions system for this stuff that's <i>entirely separate</i>
from the way Phantasmal does most of what it does, and people who
are seriously privileged under this system have full power to do
absolutely anything to the MUD if they're so inclined. That's a
generalization, but basically it's very hard to defend your
Phantasmal MUD against somebody with these privileges -- it's just
not designed for it. Once somebody can run arbitrary code, and once
they can compile objects inside the main body of your MUD, a
sufficiently clever attacker will be able to do weird and nasty
stuff to your MUD in one way or another.</p>

<p>So, let's show you how to give people this power, and what you
can do to understand it.</p>

<p>First, you should learn how to find out who can do what, and who
exists in your MUD. The <b>%access</b> command is a fine way to
determine what permissions somebody has. Just type "%access
AdminName" and it'll tell you what file access you've given them.
That file access takes the form of paths and types. For instance,
awhile back when you typed "%grant SomeIdiot / full", what you did
was to give them full (that's read/write plus admin) access to the
root directory -- in other words, full power to do anything to any
file. And yes, that would be why it's hard to stop them from
hurting your MUD if they so choose.</p>

<p>There are also global areas that anybody can read. That's
important for things like the ROOM object that other people need to
be able to inherit. So if you type "%access global" in Phantasmal,
you'll find that the "/usr/common" directory is globally readable.
That's where we store stuff like ROOM and OBJECT so it has to be
globally readable.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library (and thus Phantasmal) stores a list of
everybody that has any access that it cares about. Before you can
have any specific access, you have to be on The List. The way to
put somebody on The List is to type "%grant WhoEverTheyAre access".
To take them off the list, just type "%ungrant WhoEverTheyAre
access".</p>

<p>So <b>%access</b> tells you what they can play with. How do you
change it? <b>%grant</b> and <b>%ungrant</b> again, it turns out.
The syntax for <b>%grant</b> is "%grant AdminName &lt;path&gt;
&lt;access&gt;". Path is just the path, and AdminName is granted
the listed access to that path and all subdirectories (with some
specific exceptions that the Kernel Library provides). Access is
one of: read, write, full. Full means both read and write, but also
administrative access to do other things. The <b>%ungrant</b>
command has the same syntax, but does the opposite -- it removes
access to that path.</p>

<h3>Quotas and Resources</h3>

<p>There are certain types of resources that the Kernel MUDLib
tracks and limits. You can only use so much of any one of them
before it stops giving you any more. The <b>%quota</b> and
<b>%rsrc</b> commands let you play with them.</p>

<p>The <b>%rsrc</b> command, typed by itself, will show you the
total quota and usage of every resource for everybody in the MUD.
It may look like this:</p>
<pre>
resources                usage          max  decay  period
----------------+-------------+------------+------+---------
callouts                     1           -1
create stack                 0            5
create ticks                 0        10000
editors                      0           -1
events                       0           -1
filequota                 1167           -1
objects                    200           -1
stack                        0           50
tick usage             3589379           -1    10% per hour
ticks                        0       250000
</pre>

<p>The usage column gives the amount currently in use. The max
column tells you the total limit, and the decay column lets you
know how fast usage of that resource decays. On the left, of
course, are the resource names. Let's look at one individually. Go
ahead and type "%rsrc tick usage". You'll see something like
this:</p>
<pre>
owner                    usage          max  decay  period
----------------+-------------+------------+------+---------
Ecru                         0           -1    10% per hour
System                     308           -1    10% per hour
admin                        0           -1    10% per hour
angelbob                101333           -1    10% per hour
common                 3436295           -1    10% per hour
thedarque                    0           -1    10% per hour
    
</pre>

<p>Nifty, no? That breaks the total down into who is using what,
and their individual limits. And <b>%rsrc</b> can also be used to
set the total limit, by typing "%rsrc &lt;rsrc name&gt; &lt;new
limit&gt;". That's pretty cool. Now let's hit our final command and
see what <b>%quota</b> can do.</p>

<p>While <b>%rsrc</b> showed us a lot about the overall usage of
resources for everybody, <b>%quota</b> is more selective. Type it
by itself to see your usage of each resource, kinda like "%rsrc
YourName" would do. Type it with an admin's name to see that
admin's usage of various resources -- "%quota SomeIdiot". To see
one specific resource for one specific admin, type "%quota
AdminName &lt;resource name&gt;", such as "%quota angelbob tick
usage" or "%quota angelbob events". And finally, you can set a new
quota for an admin by typing "%quota AdminName &lt;resource
name&gt; &lt;new limit&gt;". Note that -1 means "unlimited" for
most resources, which can be a useful thing.</p>

<p>You got this far and you're still actually reading? Man, you're
really delving. We don't have much more we can show you. But go
ahead and hit any <a href="../index.html">tutorials</a> you haven't
already finished. Below is a listing of various resources and what
they mean to the Kernel MUDLib. If you micromanage this stuff,
you're ahead of me.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
  <li>callouts - this is the number of call_out functions that are
  or may be active at once.</li>

  <li>create stack - this is the amount of stack space the Kernel
  Library wants available before it will create a new object</li>

  <li>create ticks - this is the number of ticks the Kernel Library
  wants available before it will create a new object</li>

  <li>editors - this is the number of editor instances that may be
  open and active at once.</li>

  <li>events - the Kernel Library can notify subscriber lists of
  events, which Phantasmal doesn't currently bother with. This is
  the number of available/possible events.</li>

  <li>filequota - You only get a certain number of bytes of storage
  to play with in your directory (unless this is set to -1). This
  is how much you're currently using, or your maximum limit.</li>

  <li>objects - each person has a maximum number of allowed objects
  (unless this is set to -1).</li>

  <li>stack - this is the amount of stack space remaining to be
  used</li>

  <li>tick usage - this is the number of ticks that have already
  been used. Every hour it decreases by 10% in the default
  configuration.</li>

  <li>ticks - this is the number of ticks remaining to be used</li>
</ul>
