<h2>Game Design for an Unnamed Game of Light and Darkness</h2>

<p>The one-line summary: Light contends with Darkness in a bid for
the world.</p>

<p>Individual creatures are good or evil, and make their way in the
world as such. Their behavior will tilt their power toward light or
darkness. Eventually, they can become a champion of a faction of
good or evil.</p>

<p>Players and NPCs are fairly mobile, and escape and travel are
pretty easy. It's not hard to slip through enemy lines, nor to
escape from a battle when it's not going your way. This is similar
to a standard MUD. Light and dark each have safe areas that are,
y'know, pretty safe, though not absolutely 100% safe, but most
areas are disputed. Disputed areas may lean to one side or the
other, and usually do.</p>

<p>When a character is a champion of a particular faction, he gains
the ability to use the equipment specific to that faction. A
faction may have shrines, seige machinery and followers. While the
player is personally pretty mobile and may move and escape very
freely, the faction's equipment and followers move slowly, and are
probably visible at a significant distance.</p>

<p>Shrines are visible at a significant distance, and move slowly.
Some characters or followers may be able to detect them at an even
greater distance. Shrines are expressions of good or evil, and will
change the balance of the land toward good or evil. The more
powerful the shrine, the more slowly it moves, and the greater its
influence. Shrines are vulnerable - powerful characters may defile
them, reducing their power and influence. A shrine in a friendly
area will tend to 'charge up' and become more powerful, while one
in an enemy area will tend to discharge some of its power while
slowly making the land lighter or darker.</p>

<p>Characters are a sort of 'special forces' - excellent for
infiltrating enemy areas and performing missions of stealth,
subtlety or cleverness. However, great military victories will
require greater power than an individual player character can
reasonably have. Followers will be either numerous or very
powerful, or both. They move more slowly, and can be destroyed by
combat with enemy followers, or by travel through hostile lands.
Different followers may have different abilities.</p>

<p>Player characters should be easily able to escape enemy
followers unless severely outnumbered or otherwise pinned down.
However, destroying enemy followers should be quite difficult
except by using followers of one's own, or if the followers are in
severely hostile territory - light followers in dark territory or
vice-versa.</p>

<p>If territory is disputed, but tilted slightly toward light or
dark, battles will tend to cost the oppressed side more deaths than
otherwise. If the territory is severely tilted toward light or
dark, oppressed forces will lose *far* more followers in every
battle. Travellers passing through severe opposing territory will
occasionally be weakened or destroyed. This will hinder followers
very severely, since they are slow. It will hinder characters, but
not nearly as much as followers.</p>
