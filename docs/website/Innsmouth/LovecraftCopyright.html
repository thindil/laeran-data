<h3>Regarding Copyrights...</h3>

<p>Copyright law is actually rather convoluted. The following is
taken from the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">U.S.
Copyright Office</a> website regarding <a href=
"http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/circs/circ1.html#hlc">How Long
Copyright Protection Endures</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><cite><b>Works Originally Created and Published or Registered
  Before January 1, 1978</b></cite></p>

  <p><cite>Under the law in effect before 1978, copyright was
  secured either on the date a work was published with a copyright
  notice or on the date of registration if the work was registered
  in unpublished form. In either case, the copyright endured for a
  first term of 28 years from the date it was secured. During the
  last (28th) year of the first term, the copyright was eligible
  for renewal. The Copyright Act of 1976 extended the renewal term
  from 28 to 47 years for copyrights that were subsisting on
  January 1, 1978, or for pre-1978 copyrights restored under the
  Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), making these works eligible
  for a total term of protection of 75 years. Public Law 105-298,
  enacted on October 27, 1998, further extended the renewal term of
  copyrights <i>still subsisting on that date</i> by an additional
  20 years, providing for a renewal term of 67 years and a total
  term of protection of 95 years. <i>(Italics
  added.)</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since those stories published in 1922 and earlier were no longer
under copyright when Public Law 105-298 was passed in 1998, they
remain public domain. Regarding his stories published after 1922,
S. T. Joshi's biography of Lovecraft contains several very
interesting comments (pages 640-641).</p>

<p>Joshi concludes that most, if not all, of his works are in the
public domain. After Lovecraft's death, his copyrights would have
belonged to the only surviving heir appointed in his will of 1912,
his Aunt Annie Gamwell. She died four years later, and the
copyrights then devolved to two of her descendants, Ethel Phillips
Morrish and Edna Lewis. They in turn signed a document (the
"Morrish-Lewis gift") allowing Arkham House to publish all his
works, but apparently not granting them the copyrights. For a time,
Derleth claimed that the copyrights on the anthologies Arkham House
published applied to the stories themselves, which is manifestly
not the case.</p>

<p>The other route by which the copyrights could have been acquired
by Arkham House is from <i>Weird Tales</i>. On October 9, 1947,
Derleth purchased "all rights" from <i>Weird Tales</i>, but even
this is problematic - by April 1926 (and possibly sooner) Lovecraft
had been reserving all second printing rights for
himself<sup>1</sup>, so on those stories, <i>Weird Tales</i> didn't
own any rights to sell. Of the thirteen stories published in
<i>Weird Tales</i> before 1926, seven had already been published in
amateur journals, and were thereby in the public domain before
<i>Weird Tales</i> printed them; that leaves only six<sup>2</sup>
that <i>Weird Tales</i> actually owned rights to. However, repeated
searches of the Library of Congress have failed to yield any
evidence that the copyrights were renewed after 28 years -
<em>thereby allowing the stories to fall into the public domain by
operation of law.</em></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The original contracts apparently no longer exist, but there
  is considerable circumstantial evidence to support this. See page
  641 of S. T. Joshi's "H. P. Lovecraft: A Life" for more
  information.</li>

  <li>According to S. T. Joshi. I can't figure out which six he
  means - certainly, "The Temple", "The Moon-Bog", "The Outsider",
  and "He" were accepted by <i>Weird Tales</i> before April 1926.
  They may have owned second rights to "The Horror at Red Hook" as
  well, as I am not sure when this was accepted. The fact that
  Wright (editor of <i>Weird Tales</i>) required Lovecraft's
  permission to add his name to the list of plaintifs in a
  copyright violation suit in 1929 involving this story indicates
  to me that Lovecraft owned the second rights. See page 452 of S.
  T. Joshi's "H. P. Lovecraft: A Life" for more information.</li>
