<h2>Users and Connections in the Kernel</h2>

<p>The Kernel Library has a number of related objects that
determine how user logins work. They can be quite confusing if
you're not used to them.</p>

<p>This is all about using TCP, in both telnet and binary modes,
with the Kernel Library. There's also UDP (datagram) stuff, which
this page doesn't bother with.</p>

<h3>Telnet Ports and Binary Ports</h3>

<p>DGD, at a very low level, supports telnet-protocol ports and
binary-protocol ports. Its telnet protocol ports support only
line-mode telnet (as opposed to character-mode), and no
international characters, ANSI color codes or VT100 control codes.
So telnet ports are very vanilla, while binary-mode ports are what
you'd expect from a standard network library.</p>

<p>You'll need to set handlers for any telnet or binary ports you
want to use, or DGD will do it for you by default. However, for any
nontrivial protocol you'll need to do it yourself. You use two
functions in the USERD, "set_telnet_manager" and
"set_binary_manager", to do so. The first argument is what port
number the manager is for. This is an offset in the array of ports,
so pass '0' for the first port, '1' for the second port, and so on.
The second and final argument is the object that should be the
handler for the port.</p>

<p>A port handler needs to define some functions. One function is
query_timeout. The function is passed a connection object and must
return a timeout in seconds. A new connection has been established,
and the timeout returned by query_timeout is how long the
connection may remain open before it is closed for inactivity. You
can return a negative number for the timeout if you'd like the
connection to be immediately closed.</p>

<p>The function query_banner is similar: a new connection has been
established and the string returned by query_banner is sent out
immediately. If nil is returned, no banner is sent until the client
has sent something first. Usually these functions, together, give
text for your login message, and tell the MUD how long the new
client has to send you a login before you get rid of them for
inactivity.</p>

<p>The final function a handler must define is called 'select'. If
the new connection sends a line before the timeout period expires,
the select() function is called with that line so that you can
return a user object for that connection. Telnet connections in DGD
are line-mode only. Binary connections in line-mode also act as if
they are line-mode only. So if you can't wait for a newline in your
protocol, you should set the connection object to MODE_RAW as
quickly as possible with the set_mode() call. I think you can do
this in query_banner() or query_timeout() with good results.</p>

<h3>Connection Modes</h3>

<p>A number of functions return the mode that you'd like the
connection to be in after the function is called. A common mode to
return from those functions would be MODE_NOCHANGE, meaning no
change in mode. Otherwise, a telnet connection can return MODE_ECHO
(the usual) or MODE_NOECHO (for passwords, usually). A binary
connection can return MODE_LINE (for simulating line-mode telnet)
or MODE_RAW (for pure binary). There's also the 'virtual' mode
MODE_DISCONNECT, which means to disconnect the user and destruct
the connection object. There are also MODE_BLOCK and MODE_UNBLOCK,
also virtual modes related to blocking input. Input blocking is a
more advanced topic than we'll cover here, but usually it's done
when upgrading objects or otherwise performing relatively unstable
operations &mdash; at those times, you'd rather the user couldn't
do anything until your server has settled back down.</p>

<h3>How Connections Really Work Underneath</h3>

<p>If you look at DGD's documentation and then the steps above,
you'll get some idea of how the Kernel Library does what it
does.</p>

<p>When DGD calls the Kernel's Driver object with a
telnet_connect() or binary_connect() request, the Kernel returns a
telnet connection or binary connection object. DGD then calls
open() on that connection object.</p>

<p>The connection object, when open()'d, will then query the banner
and timeout via the UserD. The UserD will, in turn, call your
handler if you've registered one, or will default to its own
handler if you haven't. The connection then registers a timeout in
case the connection goes idle for longer than the acceptable
timeout.</p>

<p>At some point the connection is likely to receive data from the
non-MUD side. When that happens, receive_message() is called on the
connection. For a telnet connection or a binary connection in
MODE_LINE, the binary or telnet connection's receive_message will
wait to get a full line before calling receive_message() in its
parent class. For a binary connection in MODE_RAW, it will call the
parent immediately, without waiting for a full line. When that
happens for the very first time, the connection object will query
UserD for a user object, which will in turn call select() on your
handler, if you have set one. The select call will pass in the data
that it was handed. Note that DGD strips newlines off line-mode
telnet data, and the Kernel's binary MODE_LINE handler mimicks that
behavior. So you won't actually see the newline passed to
select.</p>

<p>The user object doesn't (yet?) have to inherit from any specific
object type. Currently its only restriction is that it should
define login(), logout(), receive_message(), message_done(),
open_datagram() and receive_datagram() in some approximately
reasonable way.</p>

<p>Because the user object doesn't have to be any specific type,
the SSH package for the kernel library cheerfully exploits this to
define another connection object (similar to the Kernel's telnet
and binary connection objects) as the user object.</p>
